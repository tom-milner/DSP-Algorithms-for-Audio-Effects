Hello!

This folder contains all the MATLAB code used in the project.
Each of the effects folders contains:
	1. 'Audio' Directory - audio files showing the effect in action.
	2. 'Plots' - plots generated by the MATLAB to showcase the theory of the effect.
	3. Code - all code used to implement the effects and generate the plots.

To run this yourself, you'll need to add the 'utils' directory to your MATLAB path.

Enjoy!
