# DSP Algorithms for Audio Effects - Public Folder

Hello, and welcome to the Public Folder for "DSP Algorithms for Musical Special Effects".
This directory contains all the work produced by the project.

The subdirectories are:

	1. "Effect Demos"
	If you want to get straight into hearing the effects, start here. There is a folder for each effect, each containing some plots and audio files to showcase the effect.

	2. "Code"
	This contains all the code for the MATLAB simulations and plots, aswell as the VST Plugin implementations.

Enjoy!

Tom
